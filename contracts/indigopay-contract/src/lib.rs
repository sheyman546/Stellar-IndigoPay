 *
 * Stellar IndigoPay — Climate Donation Tracking Contract
 *
 * This contract provides on-chain transparency for every donation:
 *
 *   1. Admin registers verified climate projects on-chain
 *   2. Donors call donate() — XLM sent directly to project wallet
 *   3. Contract records every donation immutably
 *   4. Anyone can query total raised, donor count, CO2 offset per project
 *   5. Impact badges auto-calculated based on cumulative donor totals
 *   6. Community governance: badge holders vote to verify new projects
 *
 * Build:
 *   cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
 *
 * Deploy:
 *   stellar contract deploy \
 *     --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/indigopay_contract.wasm \
 *     --source alice --network testnet
