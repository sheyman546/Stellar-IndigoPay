> Replace `OWNER` with your Expo account username. Add `EXPO_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions repository secret (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) before the first build.

- **Android**: APK (direct install, no Play Store needed)
- **iOS**: Simulator build (`.app` bundle, not a signed IPA)

## Shared API Client

The mobile app shares the API client logic with the web frontend. The API functions are located in `lib/api.ts` and are imported from the shared package.

## Wallet Integration

The app integrates with mobile Stellar wallets via deep links:

- Freighter Mobile: `freighter://tx?xdr=...`
- SEP-0007 payments: `web+stellar:pay?destination=G...&amount=50&memo=donation`
- Other wallets can be added via similar deep link schemes

### SEP-0007 support

The mobile app now registers the `web+stellar` scheme and handles incoming `web+stellar:pay` URIs from browsers and other apps. When a donation link is opened, the app shows a confirmation screen, authenticates the user, submits the Stellar payment, appends the transaction hash to the callback URL, and records the payment in scan history.

## Architecture

- **expo-router**: File-based routing
- **app/**: Screen components
- **lib/**: Shared utilities (API, Stellar SDK helpers)
- **components/**: Reusable UI components
- **styles/**: Theme and styling (matches web green theme)

See `.env.example` for required variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API URL
